# ZC-4301 Mini Project

## Description
You are required to produce a 3D scene on any one of the following topics listed below. You have to use Python and OpenGL and/or any additional tools to produce the scene.This mini-project comprises 60% of your total coursework mark.

> The submission deadline for this mini project is **Tuesday 29/10/2024 (before midnight)**.

## Available Topics

### Topic 1: Virtual Bruneian Landmark Tour
> Create a 3D virtual tour of a single iconic landmark in Brunei, such as the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque. 
- Model the landmark using basic shapes and textures.
- Implement basic interactivity to allow users to rotate the camera and zoom in/out.
- Add informative pop-ups about the landmark's history and significance.

### Topic 2: Bruneian Marine Life Showcase
> Design a simple 3D scene featuring a few recognizable marine creatures from Brunei's coast. 
- Model a few fish, corals, and a basic underwater terrain.
- Apply basic shading and textures to the models.
- Include basic animation to make the fish move around realistically.
- Users can watch the underwater scene without user interaction.

### Topic 3: Rainforest Plant Showcase
> Create a 3D environment showcasing a few types of plants found in Brunei's rainforests. 
- Model trees, flowers, and bushes using basic shapes and textures.
- Implement simple lighting to simulate natural light.
- Users can navigate the scene and click on plants to see basic information about them.

### Topic 4: Interactive Brunei Map
> Build an interactive 3D map of Brunei with simple representations of major landmarks. 
- Model basic buildings and structures.
- Allow users to click on landmarks to view pop-up information about them.
- Users can navigate the map to explore different areas.
